## About
I hacked this together in preperation for my upcoming Security+ exam. I needed help learning about the ports. 
If you want to work on this and make it better, potentially add a DB or something feel free to make a PR. 

## Tech
I used svelte and it's probably not written great but it works so far. It's kind of hacky because I used local storage and some weird functions but... it works?
